# Smart-Security-Analytics
End-to-end Security Analytics project using Python, MySQL, and Streamlit via Jupyter. Built with synthetic data to simulate real-world cybersecurity and data analysis workflows. Focused on exploring how DBMS supports both security and analytics, combining research with practical insights.

The primary goal of this project was research and hands-on practice — to understand how two different applications (Jupyter Notebook and MySQL Workbench) work together, and how a Database Management System (DBMS) can support both security analysis and data analytics simultaneously.

Through this study, I gained valuable insight into how real-world data environments operate and how they can be integrated into practical analytical systems that visualize security events and vulnerabilities. This work represents not just code, but my personal understanding and exploration of the intersection between security and data analysis.
